/*
Higher order function meets function composition
1. twice[A] means that twice takes any type A (int, string). //generics
2. (f : A => A) means that we are taking a f(unction) as an argument, and it takes type a and return type a
3. ) : A => A means that we the function will return a function that takes type a and return type a
4. when we see the = we know the real function has started. To illustrate this we can also add curly braces:
def twice[A](f : A => A) : A => A = {
  (x : A) => f(f(x))
}
5. (x : A) => f(f(x)) the function itself immediately RETURNS a function that takes in x of type A (Int) and returns our function
   within out function
6. now we are back with our function which is f(f(x)) where f = x+1. so when we have x=0 f(f(0)) = f(0+1) = 1+1

So essentially to make a function within a function we had to make a function that takes any type, define f and what the
function returns, and then at the end just return something like (x+1)+1 where ()=x for outer f

Mathematically, what we just did is represented as:
(gâˆ˜f)(x)=g(f(x))
but in our case g=f

=Function Composition: a way to combine two functions where the output of one function
becomes the input of another. In programming and functional programming (like in Scala),
this is a common pattern for chaining operations.

the weird pic is supposed to illustrate that we can skip the middle man of like storing the result and can instead
just put a function in a function

Currying:

-Different way of writing functions with 2 or more arguments
-Write f(x)(y) instead of f(x,y)
-Default in functional programming languages

/*
explanation:
printmessage 2 instantly has :, indicating everything after it is what will be returned
and that is a lambda where int and string are arguments, string is returned, and then we apply
variables and actually show the functon

printmessage 3 is similar, but each argument causes a new higher order function
like, it returns something that takes int, that returns something that takes string and returns string
then we just go on like normal but also "do => apply" for the second argument.

so now primessage3 returns a function which can have only int input, and still be a function waiting for string
or give string and int activating "both functions"

Int => (String => String) = (importance: Int) => (message: String) =>

here we do string first then int

as you can see we can simplify it to:

def doubleValue           =  computed each time when called ofc
val doubleValue           = computed once, when object is created, reuses value afterwards
lazy val doubleValue   =  computed once, when value is first used, reuses value afterwards

lazy means: wait with computing value until necessary

Eager evaluation:
Expression is computed as soon as it is bound to a variable (just like normal...)
Used in most programming languages

Lazy evaluation:
Does not compute things which are not necessary
Allows for infinite datastructures (infinite lists, trees etc)
Can save unnecessary work
Evaluation order hard to follow (hence always combined with pure functions only where order does not matter)
